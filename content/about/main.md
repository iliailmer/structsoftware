A collection of links to software projects related to the question of structural identifiability in dynamical systems.

1. [Structural Identifiability Analyzer (SIAN)](https://github.com/pogudingleb/SIAN/).
   
    * A Maple implementation of the Structural Identifiability Analyzer, described in papers below
        * [Global Identifiability of Differential Models](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpa.21921) (Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, Volume 73, Issue 9, Pages 1831-1879, 2020.) 
        * [SIAN: software for structural identifiability analysis of ODE models](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1069) (Bioinformatics, Volume 35, Issue 16, Pages 2873â€“2874, 2019)
    
        This program requires Maple 2020.1 or later for best results.

2. [SIAN-Julia](https://github.com/alexeyovchinnikov/SIAN-Julia)
    * This is the open-source implementation of the SIAN algorithm in Julia. The main advantage is that it requires no paid software to work with, only the free Julia version 1.5.0 and higher.
3. SIAN Maple.Cloud application
    * This is a free version of the Maple packgae, however, it is not open source in a sense that one cannot clone/copy it to edit anything inside the code. It has an accessible UI and documentation.
